# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* clone repo
* run command `bundle install`
* run command `rails db:migrate`
* run command `rails db:seed`
* run command `rails start`
* you should now be able to see the app running on http://localhost:3000
